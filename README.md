# 🚍 Transport Management System - C# Console Application

## Project Overview

--> The Transport Management System is a console-based application developed in **C#**, designed to manage vehicle and passenger information for transport operations.

--> The system connects to a **SQL Server** database using **ADO.NET** to perform data storage and retrieval.

--> Unit tests are implemented using **NUnit** to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

This project demonstrates the integration of application logic, database connectivity, and automated testing in a structured and maintainable manner.



## Features

--> Console-based user interface for transport management operations.

--> Vehicle information management 

--> Passenger information management

--> SQL Server database connectivity with ADO.NET 

--> Automated unit testing with NUnit  



## Technologies Used

--> **C#** - Console Application  

--> **SQL Server** - Relational Database Management System  

--> **ADO.NET** - Data access and database connectivity  

--> **NUnit** - Unit Testing Framework 

--> **Visual Studio** - Development Environment

--> **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** - Database Administration  

## Future Development
--> Development of a web-based interface integration with frontend frameworks with Angular

--> Implementation of an ASP.NET Web API to expose backend functionality

--> Addition of authentication and role-based access control

--> Extension of transport management features, including driver and route management
